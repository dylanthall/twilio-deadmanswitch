# twilio-deadmanswitch
A Dead Man's Switch written in C# + WPF, that sends its text messages (via) Twilio.

If you are interested in adopting this for your own use, you'll have to sign up for a twilio account and pay at least $20 to be able to text numbers not on your account.

Maybe in the future i will make this thing much more robust, but for now, its just something i've made for myself and it works just fine.
Shouldn't be more than 15 minutes to adapt for yourself if you really wanted to.
